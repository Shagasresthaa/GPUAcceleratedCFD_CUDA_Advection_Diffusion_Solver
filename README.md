# CS 5260 Parallel Computations Project

# GPU Accelerated Computational Fluid Dynamics Simulations (Advection Diffusion Solver)

## Running the Project

### Build Step
```bash
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja
cmake --build build
```
### Run Step
```bash
./build/cfd_sim input_config.xml

or

./build/cfm_sim_cuda input_config.xml (For the CUDA version)

```

## Visualization

For Visualization of the output data, you can use ParaView. Follow these steps:
1. Run the simulation to generate output files.
2. Open ParaView.
3. Go to `File` > `Open` and select the simulation output files generated by the simulation. They are all the vtk files in the corresponding output directory.
4. Click `Apply` to load the data.
5. Use the various visualization tools in ParaView to analyze the results.

Please note for 3D visualization, you will need to switch the representation mode from the default to Volume.
